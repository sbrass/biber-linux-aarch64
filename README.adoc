= Building biber under Linux AArch64

Fork from: https://github.com/krumeich/biber-alpine.
For detailed explanations of the setup, visit the original project.

The TeX Live distribution does not provide biber for AArch64-based Linux distros
 for Raspberry4 or AWS Instance with Graviton Processors.

The repository provides the necessary environment using self-built Docker images and runs the build process of `biber` itself within this environment.

A test setup allows to verify that the packaging process was successful and no dependency is missing using an scarce Debian image.

The resulting binary can then be packaged and uploaded to https://ctan.org.

== Building

The project provides a (GNU) Makefile to ease the build of the Docker images involved and run the Docker container to build and test `biber` binary.
[.source,bash]
----
make BRANCH="v2.18" REPO="plk/biber" test
make BRANCH="v2.18" REPO="plk/biber" package
----
Alternatively, run:
[.source,bash]
----
make BRANCH="..." REPO="..." all
----

The environment variables `BRANCH` and `REPO` allow to access a specific version or the development branch of the repository found at `https://github.com/REPO`.
`BRANCH` defaults to `dev` and `REPO` to `plk/biber`.

For debug purpose, add a run option to add a `DEBUG` environment variable (unequal to `false`):
[.source,bash]
----
make BRANCH="biber-linux-aarch64" REPO="sbrass/biber" RUN_OPTION="-e DEBUG=true"
----

== Uploading

The `biber` binary is packed as `biber-linux_aarch64.tar.gz` and needs to be wrapped in another archive with the readme from `package/README`.
[.source,bash]
----
mv biber-linux_aarch64.tar.gz && \
  cd package && \
  tar cvf biber-linux.tar.gz README biber-linux_aarch64.tar.gz
----
